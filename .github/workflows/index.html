<h1>My Inspiration</h1>
Photography was such a savior in my life. I want to use my photography to save others. For me, I am inspired by the city. I love the buzz of life and how itâ€™s something that can bring us together. I want to celebrate the beauty of the city and make it as real and as transparent as possible.
